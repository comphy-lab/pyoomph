# Applies pyoomph's determinism patches to a GiNaC source tree (run with cwd =
# the extracted GiNaC source root, i.e. the directory containing ginac/).
#
# Idempotent by design: CMake's ExternalProject_Add can re-invoke
# PATCH_COMMAND on a reconfigure even after the patches were already applied to
# that source tree (observed while developing this on branch
# deterministic_codegen), and a plain `patch -p1 -i ...` fails loudly the
# second time ("Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!"), breaking
# the build. So for each patch: try applying forward; if that fails, check
# whether it's because the patch is already applied (the *reverse* applies
# cleanly) rather than assuming so, and only then treat it as success - a
# genuine mismatch (e.g. GiNaC source changed unexpectedly) still aborts the
# build loudly.

# The first two fix the same class of bug (GiNaC hashing the ASLR-dependent
# address of an RTTI type-name string instead of something deterministic) in
# two different spots; the third stops power::to_polynomial() recursing
# forever on a negative integer power of a power with a symbolic exponent.
# See each patch's own header comment for the full rationale. Applied in
# order; add further patches to this list as found.
