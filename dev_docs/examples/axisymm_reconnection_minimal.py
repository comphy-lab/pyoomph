#  Runnable companion to dev_docs/axisymmetric_topological_changes.md, section 1.
#
#  The smallest thing that pinches: one Rayleigh-Plateau wavelength of a liquid column, driven by
#  surface tension alone, with an AxisymmetricReconnection on the free surface. Run it and it prints a
#  line per step and one "Topological change: pinch at ..." when the column breaks; the mesh is then
#  rebuilt by the `else:` branch of define_geometry below, which is also the branch every ordinary
#  quality remesh takes.
#
#      python3 dev_docs/examples/axisymm_reconnection_minimal.py
#
#  Needs shapely (pip install pyoomph[topology]) and gmsh. ~1 min, ~15000 dofs at the end.
#  The assertions in tests/test_rayleigh_plateau_pinchoff.py are made on this same scenario, at the
#  same resolution, through tests/axisymm_physics_worker.py.
