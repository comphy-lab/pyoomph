"""Passive tracer particles.

Tracers are advected by a prescribed vector field - usually the flow velocity - without feeding
back into it. Add :py:class:`TracerParticles` to a bulk domain and its particles move with the
field; add it to an interface and they are confined to that interface, advected by the *tangential*
part of the field and co-moving with the interface in the normal direction.

See ``dev_docs/tracers.md`` for the formulation and for what limits the accuracy.

        cancels analytically, so a particle in a mesh that moves under a zero advection field does

      * on an **interface** (codimension 1) they are confined to it, advected by the *tangential*

        advection: the velocity field the particles follow. Defaults to ``var("velocity")``.
        tracer_name: name of this collection on the mesh, for :py:meth:`~pyoomph.meshes.mesh.BaseMesh.get_tracers`.
        seed: where the particles start; see :py:class:`TracerSeed` and its subclasses. ``None``
            creates the collection but no particles, to be filled from Python.
        rtol, atol: tolerances of the adaptive sub-step controller, in units of the particle position.
        time_interpolation_order: order of the in-step interpolation of the mesh configuration.
            ``"auto"`` uses the best the stored nodal position history allows. This, not ``rtol``,
            is what caps the accuracy on a moving mesh.
        history_time: length of the rolling position history kept for trail plots. ``None`` keeps none.
        history_capacity: maximum number of history samples per particle.
        payloads: scalars integrated along each particle's path, as ``{name: source expression}``.
            Each source must be **dimensionless**, and is integrated over nondimensional time, so
            ``{"residence": 1}`` accumulates the time a particle has spent in the domain in units of
            the temporal scale. Multiply a dimensional rate by the appropriate scale yourself.
        statistics: print a one-line summary of each advection.
        fixed_substeps: if positive, take this many uniform sub-steps per timestep instead of
            letting the error controller choose. Only useful for order-of-convergence tests.
        max_substeps: hard upper bound on the sub-steps one particle may take within one timestep.
            Exceeding it raises - it is a backstop against a runaway, not a budget to be spent.
        max_migration_rounds: hard upper bound on the rounds of MPI migration and periodic
            re-injection per timestep. Exceeding it raises, since a particle still unfinished by
            then is bouncing between processes.
        max_periodic_wraps: how many times one particle may be re-injected at a periodic image
            within a single timestep.

    Every one of these is also a plain attribute of the underlying collection, so it can be changed

    shift is dropped), and a particle leaving through a corner where two periodic directions meet is
    handled without any special case.

    Works under MPI: the periodic image of a point at one end of the domain is usually held by an
    entirely different process, which no halo exchange can reach, so a particle whose image is not
    local is offered to every process collectively and the one holding it takes it over.
