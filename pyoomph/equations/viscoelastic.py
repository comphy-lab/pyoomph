# All models here are written in terms of the conformation tensor C (dimensionless,

#
# with the model supplying g and h. For Oldroyd-B both are C-identity, for the other

# stress definition, FENE-CR both).
#
# Under Psi=log(C) the relaxation term of the conformation equation turns into C^-1*g(C), which is
# the third method below. Every model here has a C^-1*g(C) that is a plain linear combination of
# the identity, C and C^-1 with tr(C)-dependent coefficients -- no matrix products -- which is
# what lets the log-conformation formulation avoid an eigenvalue decomposition in its relaxation

    .. _ViscoelasticEquations:

    Evolution of the conformation tensor of a differential viscoelastic constitutive model,
    together with the polymer contribution to the momentum equation. Add it alongside
    :ref:`NavierStokesEquations <NavierStokesEquations>` (or :ref:`StokesEquations <StokesEquations>`),
    whose ``dynamic_viscosity`` then plays the role of the *solvent* viscosity:

        eqs += ViscoelasticEquations(model=OldroydB(), relaxation_time=lam, polymer_viscosity=eta_p)

    By default the equations are solved in the log-conformation representation of
    Fattal and Kupferman, i.e. the unknown is :math:`\boldsymbol{\Psi}=\log\mathbf{C}` rather than
    :math:`\mathbf{C}` itself. This keeps :math:`\mathbf{C}` positive definite by construction and
    is what allows the high Weissenberg numbers at which the plain conformation formulation
    loses convergence. The evolution equation reads

    .. math::

        \partial_t\boldsymbol{\Psi} + \left(\vec{u}\cdot\nabla\right)\boldsymbol{\Psi}
        - \left(\boldsymbol{\Omega}\boldsymbol{\Psi}-\boldsymbol{\Psi}\boldsymbol{\Omega}\right)
        - 2\mathbf{B}
        + \frac{1}{\lambda}\mathbf{C}^{-1}g(\mathbf{C}) = 0

    where :math:`\boldsymbol{\Omega}` and :math:`\mathbf{B}` are the rotational and extensional
    parts of :math:`\nabla\vec{u}` in the eigenframe of :math:`\mathbf{C}`, and the constitutive
    model supplies :math:`g`. Setting ``formulation="conformation"`` instead solves the
    conventional equation for :math:`\mathbf{C}`, which is useful as a cross-check at low
    Weissenberg numbers, where both must agree.

    Only 2d Cartesian and axisymmetric coordinate systems are supported, since the eigenvalue
    decompositions with analytic derivatives in :py:mod:`pyoomph.expressions.tensor_funcs` are
    only implemented for these.

    In the 2d Cartesian case the flow is planar, so for most models :math:`C_{zz}=1` solves its own
    equation identically and is not made an unknown; it is nevertheless part of
    :math:`\operatorname{tr}\mathbf{C}`, which matters for the trace-dependent models (PTT, FENE).
    :py:class:`FENE_P` is the exception and gets :math:`C_{zz}` as an extra unknown, see

        relaxation_time: the relaxation time :math:`\lambda` of the polymer.
        polymer_viscosity: the polymer viscosity :math:`\eta_\mathrm{p}`. The solvent viscosity is the ``dynamic_viscosity`` of the (Navier-)Stokes equations.
        formulation: "log-conf" (default) or "conformation".
        space: the finite element space of the conformation (or log-conformation) components.
        field_name: the name of the tensor field. Defaults to "log_conformation" or "conformation" depending on the formulation.
        velocity_name: the name of the velocity field to advect with and to add the polymer stress to.
        wind: the velocity that transports and deforms the conformation tensor. Defaults to ``var(velocity_name)``. It supplies both the advection and the velocity gradient, since a convected derivative is defined with respect to a single velocity field.
        add_polymer_stress_to_momentum: whether to add the polymer stress to the momentum equation. Disable to drive the constitutive equation by an imposed velocity field.
        solve_out_of_plane_component: whether to solve for the out-of-plane component in a planar flow. "auto" (default) leaves that to the constitutive model. Has no effect in axisymmetric coordinates, where the azimuthal component is always an unknown.
        stabilization: None (default) for plain Galerkin, or "SUPG" for streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin on the constitutive equation. The latter is residual-based and hence consistent, so it does not change a converged solution, but it damps the oscillations that pure advection with no diffusion produces on an under-resolved mesh.
        supg_factor: multiplies the SUPG intrinsic time tau. 1 is the standard choice; lower it to stabilise more weakly.

    .. warning::

        A *stationary* solve started from the rest state can fail with SUPG switched on at full
        strength, while the same solve converges without it. The cause is not the stabilisation: at
        rest the decomposition of :math:`\nabla\vec{u}` runs entirely through its degenerate branch,
        whose reported Jacobian is truncated (see the note above), and the SUPG term multiplies that
        same residual by :math:`\tau\left(\vec{u}\cdot\nabla w\right)`, amplifying the existing
        Jacobian error. Ramping ``supg_factor`` from 0 up to 1 on an already-converged solution walks
        past it without trouble, and changes the answer by O(1e-6) once there.
        eigen_epsilon: eigenvalues of :math:`\mathbf{C}` closer than this are considered degenerate, see the note on the initial condition below.
        use_FD: let the eigenvalue decompositions fill their Jacobian by finite differences instead of the analytic expressions.
        use_subexpression: wrap the decomposition results in subexpressions. Considerably reduces the size of the generated code.
        time_scheme: an optional time stepping scheme for the constitutive equation.
        output_conformation: add the conformation tensor components, its trace and the polymer stress as output fields.
        spatial_error_estimators: add the conformation components to the spatial error estimator.

    .. note::

        At rest :math:`\mathbf{C}=\mathbf{I}`, so all eigenvalues coincide and the first Newton step
        runs entirely through the degenerate branch of the decomposition of :math:`\nabla\vec{u}`.
        That branch returns the correct residual (:math:`\mathbf{B}=\operatorname{sym}\nabla\vec{u}`,
        :math:`\boldsymbol{\Omega}=0`) but a truncated Jacobian, which costs Newton iterations
        without affecting the converged solution. Everything that carries the diagonal of the
        Jacobian is deliberately kept out of that decomposition, so a stationary solve straight from
        the rest state does converge -- see ``_in_plane_exponential``.

    r"""
    .. _ViscoelasticInflowBC:

    The fully developed conformation tensor on an inflow boundary, for the constitutive model of the
    :ref:`ViscoelasticEquations <ViscoelasticEquations>` of the adjacent bulk domain:

    .. code-block:: python

        inflow = 1.5*(1 - var("coordinate_y")**2/4)
        eqs += DirichletBC(velocity=vector(inflow, 0)) @ "inlet"
        eqs += ViscoelasticInflowBC(vector(inflow, 0)) @ "inlet"

    Prescribing only the velocity at an inlet leaves the polymer unstretched there, so the solution
    spends the whole upstream length relaxing towards the profile it should have had on entry. This
    imposes that profile instead. The argument is the same inflow velocity that the
    :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.generic.DirichletBC` above uses; the velocity gradient is obtained from it
    by differentiating symbolically with respect to the coordinates. A fully developed profile is a
    function of the transverse coordinate alone, so that gives the shear rate and nothing else. Pass
    ``velocity_gradient`` instead to give :math:`\nabla\vec{u}` directly.

    Both the planar and the axisymmetric case are covered, and in either one it is the inflow
    profile that says which direction the flow is in -- an axisymmetric pipe inlet is
    ``ViscoelasticInflowBC(vector(0, w))`` with ``w`` a function of ``var("coordinate_x")``.

    There are two ways of imposing the condition, selected by ``mode``:

    * ``"dirichlet"`` pins the components of the (log-)conformation tensor to the model's
      viscometric solution, which :py:meth:`ViscoelasticConstitutiveModel.steady_shear_coefficients`
      supplies in closed form. This costs no additional degrees of freedom and is what
      ``mode="auto"`` uses whenever the model has such a solution. It assumes the inflow to be
      unidirectional, i.e. an actual shear flow.
    * ``"enforced"`` instead demands, through a field of Lagrange multipliers on the boundary, that
      the constitutive equation itself hold there with the imposed velocity gradient and no
      variation in the flow direction. That is the same condition, but stated rather than solved,
      so it needs no closed form and is not restricted to a unidirectional profile. It is what
      ``mode="auto"`` falls back to -- for the exponential :py:class:`PTT`, whose viscometric
      solution is a Lambert W function, and for any model of your own that does not implement
      ``steady_shear_coefficients``.

    The two are not equally sharp. The Dirichlet mode is exact at the nodes; the enforced one holds
    the condition only in the weak sense, since the constraint is integrated against the Lagrange
    multiplier's test functions and is not a polynomial, so it carries a discretisation error of the
    order of the finite element space (measured at O(h^3) on a C2 space). It is also a genuine
    unknown of the problem rather than a pinned value, and therefore rather less forgiving of a cold
    start: a stationary solve from rest at a large Weissenberg number may need continuation where
    the Dirichlet mode would converge straight away. Where a model offers both, prefer the default.

    Note that this does not touch the velocity itself: add the usual
    :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.generic.DirichletBC` for that, with the same profile.

    Args:
        velocity: the imposed inflow velocity profile, as a vector expression.
        velocity_gradient: the velocity gradient, as a 3x3 matrix, instead of ``velocity``.
        mode: "auto" (default), "dirichlet" or "enforced", see above.
        space: the finite element space of the Lagrange multipliers of the enforced mode. Defaults to the space of the conformation tensor.

def symmetric_2x2_matrix_log(M: Expression, epsilon: float = 1e-30) -> Expression:
    r"""
    Analytic matrix logarithm of a symmetric positive definite 2x2 matrix.

    Uses :math:`\log\mathbf{M}=a\mathbf{I}+b\mathbf{M}` with
    :math:`b=(\log\Lambda_+-\log\Lambda_-)/(\Lambda_+-\Lambda_-)` and
    :math:`a=\log\Lambda_+-b\Lambda_+`, which follows from the fact that any function of a 2x2
    matrix is a linear combination of the identity and the matrix itself (Cayley-Hamilton).
    This is a purely symbolic expression, so it can be used e.g. to prescribe the
    log-conformation tensor on an inflow boundary.

    Degenerate eigenvalues are handled, which matters because the obvious use of this function hits
    them: prescribing the inflow conformation of a channel makes it isotropic on the symmetry line,
    where the shear rate vanishes. The b coefficient is then 0/0. Regularising the denominator sends
    b to 0 there, and that happens to be exactly right rather than merely safe -- for an isotropic
    M = Lambda*I the result collapses to a*I = log(Lambda)*I, which is the correct logarithm. The
    epsilon only degrades the answer when the two eigenvalues are separated by an amount comparable
    to it, which for the default is far below anything representable in the surrounding computation.
