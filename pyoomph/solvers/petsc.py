# The command line is handed on so that PETSc/SLEPc options can be given on it -- but only the
# single-dashed part of it. PETSc records EVERY dash-prefixed token it is given, whether or not it
# knows the name, and lists the ones nothing read at PetscFinalize as possible spelling mistakes; with
# the raw argv that meant a plain `python3 script.py --petsc_mumps --outdir out` ended in a warning
# about pyoomph's own flags. Dropping the double-dashed ones costs nothing, because PETSc files
# `--ksp_type` under a name its own lookups never match (hasName("ksp_type") is False for it), so a
# double-dashed PETSc option has never taken effect anyway.
#
# Every other single-dashed token is passed through untouched -- that is how PETSc options are written
# -- except pyoomph's one short flag, -P (i.e. --parameter), which is indistinguishable from a PETSc
# option and would be reported on every run that uses it. Only the flag itself has to go: PETSc ignores
# tokens that do not start with a dash, so the values left behind by a dropped flag are already inert.

        PETSc reports a failed factorisation by setting a negative KSPConvergedReason and returning
        immediately, leaving the solution vector exactly as it found it. Nothing downstream can tell
        that apart from a real solution, so it used to reach the Newton solver as an ``inf`` residual
        with nothing to say where it came from.

        Only the two reasons in _RECOVERABLE_KSP_FAILURES are acted on; every other way a KSP can end
        negative keeps its old behaviour and merely gains a warning.

        The retry is not cosmetic; it is what makes the failure recoverable at all. Keeping the KSP
        alive across solves (see _setup_solver_if_needed) means PETSc sees SAME_NONZERO_PATTERN and
        reuses MUMPS' *analysis* -- and with ICNTL(6)=5 that analysis is value-dependent: it fixes a
        maximum-transversal permutation and a scaling from the matrix it first saw. As a continuation
        walks the values away from that matrix the ordering stops being a good one, off-diagonal
        pivoting grows (INFOG(12) went 288 -> 2638 on the case this was written for) and the fill-in
        finally exceeds the workspace that stale analysis predicted: INFOG(1) = -9. Discarding the KSP
        forces a fresh analysis for the values actually on hand, which is what makes the retry work.

        Without that, the failure is permanent, not transient: the failed PC stays cached, so every
        later solve returns in microseconds with the same error. An arclength continuation then halves
        its step against a solver that can no longer solve anything, all the way down to its minimum
        step, and reports a spurious "arc-length step has fallen below minimum tolerance".

        Rebuilding rather than switching the reuse off is deliberate: on that same case the reused
        symbolic factorisation was worth 2.7x on the in-process KSP solve time (2.4 s against 6.5 s
        over the run), so the fast path is worth keeping and paying for a rebuild when it goes stale.

        Safe under MPI: KSPSolve reduces the PC failure across the communicator, so getConvergedReason
        agrees on every rank and all of them take the same (collective) rebuild branch.

        Deliberately much smaller than PETSCSolver._ksp_solve_checked, because only one of the two
        problems that method exists for is present here.

        *Not* the stale-analysis problem. Every call to solve() builds J, M and the EPS from scratch
        and destroys all three at the end, so the ST's KSP, its PC and the MUMPS instance inside it are
        new each time and MUMPS always re-runs its analysis on the matrix actually being factorised.
        The value-dependent ordering that goes stale when a KSP is kept alive (dev_docs 7h) cannot
        arise; there is nothing here to discard and rebuild.

        *Not* the silent-garbage problem either. SLEPc's STSetDefaultKSP calls
        KSPSetErrorIfNotConverged(st->ksp, PETSC_TRUE), so a failed solve inside the spectral transform
        raises out of EPSSolve instead of returning an untouched vector, and PETSc's MUMPS wrapper
        already names the code: "MUMPS error in numerical factorization: INFOG(1)=-9". No reason to
        add a convergence check the library performs itself.

        What *is* worth having is the escalation. A shift-and-invert factorises J - sigma*M, which is
        commonly denser than J alone, so it runs out of MUMPS workspace more readily than the linear
        solver does -- and pyoomph never sets st_mat_mumps_icntl_14 unless use_mumps() was given an
        explicit mumps_param14, which asks the user to have foreseen the whole thing. Doubling it and
        running again is MUMPS' own prescription, and it turns a dead run into a slower one.

        Keep doubling rather than trying once: a single retry raises ICNTL(14) from MUMPS' default of
        20 to 40, and 40 is not a lot. The lubrication problem this loop was written for (a 1D film
        with a periodic BC and a volume constraint, so two dense rows in 20002) needs 60, and used to
        fail on the retry -- an escalation that gives up one step short of the answer buys nothing.
        _increase_mumps_icntl14 caps at 1000 and reports that it could not move, which ends the loop.

        Anything that is not a MUMPS workspace error is re-raised untouched, so a genuinely singular
        shifted matrix, a bad target or a non-MUMPS factorisation fails exactly as it did before.
