"""The Spectra eigensolver backend (idname "spectra").

Spectra (https://spectralib.org) is a header-only Arnoldi eigensolver on top of Eigen, downloaded and
compiled into the extension module by cmake/ThirdPartySpectra.cmake. It exists here for the platforms
that have no PETSc/SLEPc at all - Windows above all, where the wheels are built without MPI and hence
without PETSc - and it is the only backend there that can TARGET an eigenvalue: the ARPACK-based
"scipy"/"pardiso" backends raise on any target, which leaves Hopf tracking and the normal-form
calculations falling back to worse routes (see supports_complex_target() in .generic).

Compared with SLEPc this covers everything except the contour-integral region search
(SlepcEigenSolver.set_eigenvalue_region), and it is serial: a distributed problem is gathered onto
rank 0 by GenericEigenSolver._solve_gathered_on_root, exactly as the scipy backend does.

Spectra itself only offers the STANDARD eigenproblem for a general matrix. Its generalized solvers
(SymGEigsSolver, SymGEigsShiftSolver) require A symmetric and B positive definite, which pyoomph mass
matrices violate: they are positive semi-definite and SINGULAR, since pressure and pinned rows carry
no time derivative. So the shift-and-invert transform is applied here instead, exactly as SLEPc's ST
does internally:

    J v = lambda M v    <=>    (J - sigma*M)^-1 M v = nu v ,   lambda = sigma + 1/nu

which works for an arbitrary M - non-symmetric, indefinite or singular. The infinite eigenvalues a
singular M produces map to nu = 0, which the "largest magnitude" selection never converges to.
