tkinter, so the whole workflow (continuation, bifurcation location, branch switching, saving and
reloading) can be driven headlessly from a test or a batch script. The user interface talks to it
through the observer hooks installed by :py:meth:`BifurcationController.set_observer`.

        synthetic value the tracker reports - 0 + i*omega, exactly zero in the real part, which is
        what makes the point read as a bifurcation everywhere the diagram tests ``eig_value_Re == 0``.
        Re-solving THAT would turn the exact zero into a small nonzero number and the point would stop
        being a bifurcation.

        The rest of the spectrum is worth having and is solved for here: on a locus a second

        of the spectrum is what says whether the branch was already unstable and which mode goes next.

        Problem.solve_eigenproblem; it needs a nonzero shift (self.tracked_eigen_shift, which is also
        how the whole thing is switched off), since the tracker has just put an eigenvalue exactly
        where a zero shift would factorise.

        ``critical`` REPLACES the entry of the solved spectrum it belongs to rather than being pushed
        in front of it, so the tracked mode is listed once and at its exact value; ``tracked_index``
        says which entry that is. Recording both copies would show the same mode twice, a hand-width

        ``spectrum`` and ``tracked_index`` are None when no extra eigensolve was taken - switched off,

        A located REAL bifurcation has an exactly singular Jacobian, which is what makes it one - and
        a shift-invert eigensolve at sigma = 0 asks the transform to factorise it. Measured on a
        pitchfork at mu = 0 with a second mode at -1: the critical eigenvalue came back as
        +0.3678794411714423 (and on another problem as -1.2e18, and on a third it was simply absent
        from the spectrum), so the mode the classification is about was not in the answer at all. The
        normal form then either failed outright - "the left eigenvector solve landed on the
        eigenvalue 1.3e-23 instead of the requested 0.368" - or was built from another mode.

        This is the same hazard :py:attr:`tracked_eigen_shift` exists for, one step later: that one

        eigensolve taken after it has let go. Its value is reused, since it is the shift the user has

        a transient leaves one wherever it settles, and the first point of a diagram is just a solve;
        none of them is an arclength step, so oomph holds no tangent afterwards and the point drew no
        arrow at all until the step after it had been taken. But the tangent is a property of the point,
        not of how the point was reached, so it can simply be computed: one solve of J dU = -dR/dp,
        normalised onto the arclength constraint, which is what the end of every step does anyway.

        Not at a bifurcation on an ORDINARY branch - the plain Jacobian is singular there, and it is
        the one place where having no tangent is the right answer: :py:meth:`_update_tangents` empties
        the arrows there on purpose, and :py:meth:`_prime_fold_continuation_tangent` recognises a fold

        The arclength scaling is switched off for the call. With it on, oomph retunes theta^2 as part of
        computing the derivatives, so that the parameter takes its desired share of the arclength - 50%
        by default - and the tangent comes back normalised in a metric that is not the one in force. It
        showed as dparameter/ds = 1/sqrt(2) at every point regardless of the branch: on a pitchfork arm,
        where the true value is 0.758, that is a visibly wrong direction. Retuning belongs at the end of

        manoeuvre is available to a plain script; what is here is the part that is about the diagram -
        which point we are at, opening a branch for the result, and the step size to carry on with.

        Both the offset and the direction default to what the continuation is set to: the offset to the
        parameter step the current ds buys (:py:meth:`branch_switch_parameter_offset`) and the direction
        to the sign of ds. So the keys that steer a sweep steer this too - ``/`` picks which side of a
        transcritical, or which arm of a pitchfork, is tried first, and ``+``/``-`` how far off the
        bifurcation the switch aims.

        unstable mode, it damps it - BDF2's amplification factor tends to zero as lambda*dt grows - and
        the adaptive stepper walks straight into that: the solution sits near a stationary state, so the
        temporal error is tiny, so dt is doubled every step. Measured on a thin-film branch point, dt
        reached 500 growth times and the run came back to the very solution it was told to leave, with
        the same eigenvalue to six digits.

        That argument only holds while the mode is what is growing. Once the solution is far from the
        branch the dynamics are the nonlinear approach to wherever it is going, the temporal error
        controller is a sound judge of it again, and holding dt at the old cap only makes the departure
        take a long time in small steps. So the distance from the branch is watched, and the cap is

        stops changing, which is the solution having arrived. A limit cycle never stops changing, so
