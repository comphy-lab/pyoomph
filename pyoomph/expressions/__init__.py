def conditional(cond:Union["_pyoomph.RelationalExpression",bool,ExpressionOrNum],iftrue:ExpressionOrNum,iffalse:ExpressionOrNum)->Expression:
	"""
	Branches on a symbolic comparison, e.g. ``conditional(var("time")<2*second, 1, 2)``. The comparison is kept
	symbolically until the expression is either called with concrete values, e.g. ``expr(time=4*second)``, or compiled
	into the generated code, where it becomes a ternary.

	This function is required because Python's own ternary ``iftrue if cond else iffalse`` cannot be used: Python always
	casts the condition to a plain ``bool`` first, so the branch would be selected immediately instead of symbolically.

	Comparisons can be combined with ``~`` (not), ``&`` (and), ``|`` (or) and ``^`` (xor), e.g.
	``conditional((var("time")>1*second) & (var("time")<2*second), 1, 2)``. Python's keywords ``not``, ``and`` and ``or``
	cannot be used for the same reason as the ternary, and neither can a chained comparison like ``a<b<c``, which Python
	expands into ``(a<b) and (b<c)``; write ``(a<b) & (b<c)`` instead. Mind that the bitwise operators bind *tighter*
	than the comparisons, so each operand needs its own parentheses. The named
	:py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.logical_and`, :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.logical_or`,
	:py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.logical_not` and :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.logical_xor` avoid that pitfall.

	Only the four inequalities ``<``, ``<=``, ``>`` and ``>=`` build such a symbolic comparison. ``==`` and ``!=`` are
	deliberately left alone, since Python requires them to return a plain ``bool`` for expressions to remain usable in
	dicts, sets and ``in`` tests; ``a == b`` therefore is an identity comparison and
	:py:meth:`~pyoomph._pyoomph_core.Expression.is_equal` or ``(a-b).is_zero()`` is what tests two expressions for
	equality. A symbolic equality branch can be written as two nested conditionals, e.g.
	``conditional(a<=b, conditional(a>=b, iftrue, iffalse), iffalse)``, but mind that this compares floating point
	numbers exactly in the generated code.

	Both sides of the comparison must have the same unit. As in :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.piecewise_geq0`, the
	branches `iftrue` and `iffalse` must agree in units as well, which then are the units of the result, and a plain
	``0`` is accepted as a branch irrespective of the unit of the other branch.

	Parameters:
		cond: A comparison of two expressions (``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, ``>=``), a plain ``bool``, or an expression, which
			is then tested for being ``>=0``.
		iftrue (ExpressionOrNum): The value to return if the condition holds.

	nondim (bool, optional): Flag indicating whether the computation is with respect to non-dimensional coordinates. Defaults to False.
	coordsys (BaseCoordinateSystem, optional): The coordinate system in which the computation is performed. Defaults to None, i.e. the coordinate system of either the current or parent equations or the problem.

	Returns:
	Expression: The computed divergence expression.
 
	Notes:
		if you calculate div(u) on a boundary, you will get the surface divergence, even if u is defined in the bulk.
		To get the bulk divergence at the boundary, use div(var("u",domain="..")) instead.

		Index order: for a rank-2 tensor, ``div(T)[i]`` is :math:`\\partial_j T_{ij}`, contracting the second index. This
		makes ``div`` the adjoint of :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.generic.grad` (which stores
		:math:`\\partial u_i/\\partial x_j`) and ``div(T)`` the
		integration-by-parts partner of ``weak(T,grad(v))`` together with the traction ``matproduct(T,n)``. For symmetric
		tensors, i.e. every usual stress tensor, the distinction does not matter. Note that a flux tensor has to be
		assembled accordingly: the momentum flux carrying :math:`\\vec{u}` along :math:`\\rho\\vec{q}` is
		``dyadic(u,rho*q)``, so that :math:`F_{ij}=\\rho u_i q_j`.
