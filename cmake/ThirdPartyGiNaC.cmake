# Finds (or downloads and builds) CLN and GiNaC.
#
# GiNaC and CLN are autotools projects, not CMake projects, so "downloading

# ./configure && make && make install via ExternalProject_Add - CMake itself
# never compiles their sources directly.
#
# NOTE: the exact ./configure flags GiNaC/CLN accept (e.g. how GiNaC is told
# where to find CLN) can vary a bit by version. The flags below work for
# recent GiNaC/CLN autotools releases as of this writing, but if you hit a
# "./configure: unrecognized option" style failure, check
# `<extracted-source>/configure --help` for that exact version and adjust
# GINAC_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_FLAGS / CLN_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_FLAGS below (or pass them
# in via -DGINAC_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_FLAGS=... / -DCLN_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_FLAGS=...).

#   PYOOMPH_CLN_INCLUDE_DIR_RESOLVED / PYOOMPH_GINAC_INCLUDE_DIR_RESOLVED
#   PYOOMPH_CLN_LIBRARY / PYOOMPH_GINAC_LIBRARY
# and (when downloading) the ExternalProject targets cln_external /
# ginac_external, which the extension module is made to depend on.

# Otherwise CLN/GiNaC can end up compiled for a different architecture than

# PYOOMPH_CLN_VERSION / PYOOMPH_GINAC_VERSION are meant to either be left
# empty (auto-detect the current release on every configure) or explicitly
# pinned by the caller (e.g. -DPYOOMPH_GINAC_VERSION=1.8.9, to reproduce an
# old build). The tricky part is that once auto-detection resolves a version
# into that same cache variable, a naive "only resolve if empty" check (as
# used to be here) makes it stick forever afterwards, indistinguishable from
# a deliberate pin - and ginac.de removes old tarballs as soon as a new
# release replaces them. That combination is exactly how this was found: a
# build tree's cache had PYOOMPH_GINAC_VERSION=1.8.7 left over from an
# earlier configure; ginac.de had since moved on to 1.8.10, so the
# ExternalProject download 404'd deep inside the ninja build log instead of
# failing at configure time with an actionable message.
#
# Fix: mirror whatever gets auto-resolved into a paired *_AUTODETECTED
# internal cache entry, so a later configure can tell "we set this ourselves
# last time" apart from "the caller pinned this deliberately":
#  - value empty, or equal to our own last recorded marker -> re-detect
#    (self-heals against ginac.de rotating its tarball on every configure).
#  - value present but no marker recorded yet -> this is a build tree from
#    before this self-healing logic existed (exactly the case that motivated
#    it - see above). Give it the benefit of the doubt only if it's actually
#    broken: check whether it's still downloadable, and re-detect only if not.
#  - value present and *differs* from a recorded marker -> an unambiguous
#    deliberate override; left alone unconditionally (pyoomph_check_tarball_
#    reachable below still catches a typo'd/dead pin, just louder and later).
