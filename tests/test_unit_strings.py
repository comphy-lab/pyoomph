# unit_to_string(value) -> (unit, factor, multiplier), where factor*multiplier is the number to print
# in front of that unit. The property that matters is that the PRINTED quantity equals the input:
# "1 um^2" must not be handed back for 1e-6 m^2, which is a million times larger.
#
# The prefix-estimating branch had no coverage at all - every call in pyoomph passes
# estimate_prefix=False - and it was wrong in four separate ways, all found once the bifurcation GUI
# started using it to report eigenvalues in 1/s and observables in their own units.
