# Second derivatives of CustomMultiReturnExpression, i.e. multi-return callbacks inside an analytic
# Hessian.
#
# A multi-return callback is a black box: pyoomph gets its value and, at runtime, its Jacobian
# w.r.t. the arguments, and builds the chain rule around them symbolically. Until this was added the
# chain rule stopped after one differentiation ("Multi-Return Callbacks can only be derived to the
# first order at the moment"), which put every one of them out of reach of an analytic Hessian and
# so out of reach of every eigenvalue, bifurcation, Floquet and orbit workflow.
#
# What each test here really checks is d2R/du_j du_k, through
# Problem.debug_analytic_hessian_by_fd(): it contracts the analytic Hessian with random vectors and
# compares against a central difference of the analytic Jacobian along one of them. Its noise floor
# on these problems is around 1e-9, so a 1e-5 threshold is four orders of magnitude of headroom -
# and dropping the second-derivative term entirely takes the discrepancy to O(1), which is what
# makes the check worth anything.
#
# The residual has to be nonlinear in the callback's RESULT as well as in its argument, otherwise
# d2/du2 of the callback never enters and the tests pass without exercising anything.

def test_fold_tracking_through_a_multi_return_callback(tmp_path):
    """Track a fold in a residual that goes through a multi-return callback.

    This is the case the feature exists for, and it is also the one the Hessian-mode bug corrupted:
    a fold handler reaches HessianVectorProduct through
    fill_in_contribution_to_hessian_vector_products, which passes Hessian mode 0 - and mode 0 used
    to be forwarded to the callback as "do not fill the derivative matrix", while the Hessian body
    read that matrix regardless.

    The problem is u^2 = lam with u^2 supplied by the callback. Its fold is at lam = 0, u = 0.
    Both dispatch paths are exercised: an ODE this small converges to the fold exactly, so a
    wrong Hessian shows up as a failure to converge rather than as a slightly wrong number.
