# The analytic Jacobian that UNIFACMultiReturnExpression emits into its generated C.
#
# A multi-return callback is a black box to GiNaC: pyoomph asks it for its value and, separately,
# for its Jacobian with respect to the arguments, and builds the chain rule around them. Original
# and Dortmund UNIFAC used to answer the second question with FILL_MULTI_RET_JACOBIAN_BY_FD, i.e.
# one extra evaluation of the whole model per argument, accurate to about sqrt(epsilon). They now
# propagate the derivatives alongside the value in a single pass (analytic_c_jacobian), so what is
# emitted has to be checked against the values it is supposed to be the derivative of.
#
# The mole fractions the model is written in are not the arguments: they are clipped away from 0
# and 1 and renormalised when they sum to more than one. That mapping is piecewise, so it is done
# at runtime and its chain rule is a loop at the end of the generated function - which is exactly
# the part a hand-derived Jacobian gets wrong. The tests therefore also visit compositions inside
# the clipped and the renormalised branch.

    equation_compilation_flags.debug_jacobian_epsilon assembles the analytic elemental Jacobian

    finite-difference one calls the callback with flag=0, i.e. for values only, so this compares
    the emitted Jacobian against the emitted values - through pyoomph's own chain rule.

    The report is written by the C++ side, so it has to be captured at file-descriptor level

    nothing at all, which is indistinguishable from a Jacobian that agrees.
