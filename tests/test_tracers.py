#  Passive tracer particles (dev_docs/tracers.md).
#
#  The advection field is given as an ANALYTIC EXPRESSION of the coordinates, never as a solved
#  field. That is deliberate: it removes the discretisation error entirely, so every assertion here
#  measures the tracer machinery and nothing else. Several of the cases then have an exact answer,
#  and are asserted at machine zero rather than at a tolerance - which is what makes them able to
#  catch the class of defect this rewrite existed to fix, all of which were silent:
#
#   * the mesh Jacobian being taken at the end-of-step configuration for every sub-step,
#   * the ALE term not being blended over the sub-step,
#   * the ALE term not being emitted AT ALL on a mesh without position dofs, so that a mesh moved by
#     hand or by macro elements dragged its tracers with it.
#
#  Three exactness statements recur:
#
#   * In the BULK the ALE term cancels analytically, so a particle in a moving mesh with a zero
#     advection field must not move at all - every Runge-Kutta stage derivative is identically zero,
#     not a cancellation of two rounded terms.
#   * On an INTERFACE the pseudo-inverse projects the field onto the tangent space, so a purely
#     normal advection field moves nothing, and nodes sliding tangentially under a stationary
#     particle move nothing either.
#   * A field that is constant along a particle's own path is integrated exactly by any Runge-Kutta
#     method, so Poiseuille flow gives the analytic straight line to round-off.

    end and a tangential advection pushing it off. The two speeds are the two ways the sub-step

      * fast - the overshoot past the end does not shrink with the sub-step, so h collapses through
        1e-12 in about forty halvings and the "the particle is leaving" branch is reached as it
        always was. Only the pinning is new here.
      * slow - the overshoot IS proportional to the sub-step, so the halved step is accepted, the
        controller grows h straight back because the error estimate is tiny, and tau crawls forward
        at rounding scale. Without the progress watchdog this runs a million sub-steps and then
        raises; it was found at the apex of a real evaporating droplet.

    Either way the particle stays. Dropping it - which is what a bulk particle leaving its domain
