# The index order of grad, div and the contraction operators.
#
# pyoomph stores grad(u)[i,j] = d(u_i)/d(x_j), the Jacobian, and contracts adjacent indices
# everywhere: dot/contract/matproduct all pair the index of a matrix that faces the other operand,
# and div of a rank-2 tensor contracts the second index, which makes it the adjoint of grad. Two of
# those used to be the other way round -- contract contracted the outer index, and div the first
# index -- and the two reversals cancelled for the terms people actually write, which is why nothing
# noticed. Hence this file: none of it was pinned before.
#
# Note that the symbolic route is not available for anything involving grad: a gradient of a field
# stays a held Diff(..., nondimfield(...)) until the code generator resolves it, so
# (lhs - rhs).is_zero() is False even for expressions that are identical. Everything below that
# touches grad therefore goes through a compiled element, projecting the expression onto a C2 field
# and reading the nodal values back.

    The azimuthal row of the axisymmetric tensor divergence, against hand-derived references.

    This row is unreachable from any tensor the axisymmetric system can build from fields:
    define_tensor_field puts the azimuthal component on the diagonal only and vector_gradient hard-zeros
    the azimuthal off-diagonals, since plain axisymmetry has no azimuthal velocity component. So the
    dyadic-identity test above cannot reach it either -- (b.grad)a on the right-hand side would need the
    swirl terms of vector_gradient that are not there -- and the reference has to come from outside.

    Each case below is div(a (x) b) = div(b)*a + (b.grad)a worked out by hand in the orthonormal
    cylindrical frame, using d_phi(anything) = 0 and the frame derivatives d_phi(e_r) = e_phi,
    d_phi(e_phi) = -e_r. Slot order is (r, z, phi), so vector(h,0,0) is radial and vector(0,0,k)
    azimuthal.

    Both forms of this row were wrong before: the 2d one had (T_phir - T_rphi)/r, which is zero for a
    symmetric tensor and the wrong sign otherwise, and the radial one had (2*T_phir - T_rphi)/r, which is
    wrong even for a symmetric tensor. The first case here is what pins the sign -- it has T_rphi != 0
