# ========================================================================

# Code generation for the azimuthal (m!=0) contributions on a MOVING mesh. Three defects lived here,
# all of which only appear when the expansion, the moving mesh and one further ingredient meet:
#
#  1. A cached subexpression derivative is a scalar C variable, so it must hold the pure partial
#     derivative. Differentiating by a coordinate field also produced the moving-mesh dpsi/dX terms,
#     which are l_shape-indexed arrays, and the generated code did not compile:
#         domain.c: error: 'l_shape' undeclared
#     Needs subexpr() + azimuthal + moving mesh + a second spatial derivative inside the subexpression.
#
#  2./3. absolute() and signum() did not tell GiNaC that they are real (and, for absolute(),
#     non-negative). power::real_part() only leaves a fractional power alone when its basis reports
#     info_flags::nonnegative, so tau = 1/sqrt(sum of squares) was rewritten into polar form,
#     |X|^p*(cos+I*sin)(p*atan2(Im,Re)), and the element failed to LOAD with
#         undefined symbol: imag_part
#     signum() gets there through d|x| = signum(x) dx.
#
# Both tests are cheap: tiny meshes, and no eigensolver is required.
