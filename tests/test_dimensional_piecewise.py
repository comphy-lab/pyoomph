# Units in piecewise_geq0(cond, a, b).
#
# The three arguments have unrelated dimensions: only the sign of cond selects a branch, so its
# unit and (positive) scale divide out, whereas a and b are alternatives of one quantity and must
# therefore agree. Before collect_base_units() knew about the function, any dimensional argument
# was left inside the call by the generic-function fallback and the residual was then rejected with
# "CANNOT SEPARATE UNITS AND REST" - the branch had to be written with heaviside() instead.
