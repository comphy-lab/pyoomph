# ========================================================================

# A multi-return callback is real by construction - its ABI takes a double* and fills a double*, so
# it can neither receive nor return an imaginary part. GiNaC has to be told, because its default for
# an unknown function is "possibly complex", and taking a real part DISTRIBUTES:
#     real_part(g*w) -> real_part(g)*real_part(w) - imag_part(g)*imag_part(w)
# Without the hooks the second term survives with a spurious imag_part(g) in it, so real_part could
# not be moved across a callback and imag_part(g) was not zero. That is what these tests pin.
#
# Scope, measured rather than assumed: no azimuthal or normal-mode stability result could be made to
# depend on this. The expansion never routes the residual through GiNaC's real_part - it derives two
# separate named residual contributions by expansion mode - and a user-written real_part() reaches
# the EXPANDED node (GiNaCMultiRetCallback, a pyginacstruct, whose real_part/imag_part/conjugate
# already answer itself/0/itself) before anything is printed. An azimuthal m=1 sweep over sqrt(g),
# subexpression(1/sqrt(g)), g**(3/2), absolute(g), real_part(g*u) and imag_part(g*u), with and
# without a moving mesh, gave byte-identical eigenvalues before and after the hooks were added. So
# these are consistency tests between the two stages of the same callback, not a repair of a wrong
# number - keep them cheap and symbolic.
#
# They are written as invariants of a REAL quantity rather than as a comparison against the same
# function spelled out symbolically: exp(u) and a callback computing exp(u) are NOT interchangeable
# under real_part, because GiNaC does not know that the field u is real either, so real_part of the
# symbolic one legitimately expands into something else.
