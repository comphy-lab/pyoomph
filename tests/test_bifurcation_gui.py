# ========================================================================

# The bifurcation GUI's numerics had no coverage at all while they lived inside the key handler of a
# matplotlib window: there was no way to reach step(), locate_bifurcation() or the save/load
# round-trip without a display. They now sit in BifurcationController, which knows nothing about
# matplotlib or tkinter, so the whole workflow can be driven from here.
#
# The test problem is du/dt = mu - u^2 - b*u, with TWO global parameters. At b = 0 it is the
# textbook saddle-node: branches u = +-sqrt(mu) meeting at a fold at mu = 0, eigenvalue -2u. In
# general the stationary states are mu = u^2 + b*u and the fold sits where d(mu)/du = 2u + b = 0,
# i.e. at u_c = -b/2 and mu_c(b) = -b^2/4 - a parabolic fold locus, known in closed form. Every
# assertion below is therefore checked against theory rather than against the code's own output,
# which is what makes locate_bifurcation() and (later) the fold-locus continuation testable at all.
#
# The second parameter also exists to pin the slice bookkeeping: a diagram continued in mu is only
# valid at one value of b, and that has to be recorded.
#
# Only ONE Problem is constructed per process: a second one segfaults in the JIT loader, which is
# why the module has a single test function rather than one per aspect.

    Four invocations, the first two against the same output directory since surviving from one run to

    solves before building the GUI has already initialised the problem under the default "delete"

    state.json included, which is the index that references the state dumps.

    block skipped the problem sits at its raw initial condition, so the initial solve that start() used
    to do unconditionally would be working from a guess the script never intended.
