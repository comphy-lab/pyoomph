# Does the arclength continuation tangent survive a mesh adaptation in a USABLE state?
#
# pyoomph carries it across by stashing the two continuation vectors in history slots 5 and 6 before the
# adapt and reading them back afterwards (Problem._adapt_with_interfacial_errors), so oomph's projection
# onto the new mesh interpolates them - much better than oomph's own path, which zero-fills
# Dof_derivative when the dof count changes.
#
# What it did not do was renormalise. The interpolation preserves the tangent's DIRECTION (measured:
# cos = 0.999999 against a freshly computed one) but not its length, since |dU/ds|^2 is a sum over dofs:
# refining 39 -> 79 dofs grew it by sqrt(2). The constraint
#
#     (dparameter/ds)^2 + theta^2*|dU/ds|^2 = 1
#
# is what gives ds its meaning as a step length, so the first step after an adapt came out 29% short.
#
# Bratu, u'' + lam*exp(u) = 0 with a time derivative added so a mass matrix exists, is used because
# refining it changes ndof without changing the physics.
