# AxisymmetricReconnection under mpirun, with and without --distribute (stage 7 of the axisymmetric
# pinch-off/coalescence rewrite; the geometry itself is pinned by the serial suites
# tests/test_axisymm_*).
#
# What can go wrong here is not a wrong number, it is the ranks disagreeing:
#
# * the detection is a morphological statement about the WHOLE interface. Read off a partition it is
#   a different, truncated shape, cut wherever the partition happens to run - and a waist sitting on
#   a partition boundary is not a corner case, it is what partitioning by element count does. So the
#   interface is merged, the plan is made on rank 0 and broadcast, and every rank must end up with
#   the IDENTICAL plan: define_geometry then rebuilds the geometry from it with no further
#   communication, and two ranks with different plans describe two different geometries.
# * the overlap guard runs on every Newton step and returns a bool. A rejection seen by some ranks
#   and not the others abandons the solve on those alone.
# * a remesh is collective throughout (gmsh, the transfer, the re-distribution), so a rank that does
#   not ask for it waits for the others for ever rather than failing.
#
# Every run is therefore under a timeout that fails rather than waits, and every assertion is about
# all the ranks agreeing - with each other and with a serial run of the very same worker.
