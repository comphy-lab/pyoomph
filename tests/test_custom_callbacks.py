# A CustomMultiReturnExpression implemented in Python only, i.e. without generate_c_code(), so the
# generated element code cannot inline it and has to call back into Python through
# my_func_table->invoke_multi_ret at every integration point.
#
# That path writes its results into a buffer owned by the C++ side, which is handed to eval() as a
# numpy array. It has to be a VIEW of that buffer. nanobind decides between a view and a copy from
# whether the array has an owner (ndarray_export(): copy = th->owner == nullptr && th->self ==
# nullptr), and with no owner attached the callback filled a copy that nobody ever read back: every
# such callback silently returned zero, and so did every derivative it was asked for. Nothing
# complained -- the residual was simply built from zeros.
#
# The same class WITH a C implementation is used as the control throughout: it exercises the other
# branch of write_code_multi_ret_call, never went through nanobind, and was never affected.
